# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

<!-- to dos list with context instead of props -->

<!-- import the todo folder in app file -->
<!-- firstly create the todocontext file for passing props -->
<!-- then create the index file in which all the input feilds and button reside -->
<!-- then create the mapping file which is the todos file -->
<!-- then create the todo list file in which the list appears first -->
